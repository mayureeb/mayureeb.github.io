As a South East Asian female PhD student in engineering, I am committed to promoting justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI) in all aspects of my work and the broader academic community. This commitment stems from my own experiences as a member of a historically underrepresented group, and my belief that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed and contribute to the scientific community.
To start with, I believe that justice is critical in creating a fair and equitable academic environment. Justice requires treating all individuals with respect and ensuring that their voices are heard. It also requires addressing issues such as harassment, discrimination, and bias that can prevent individuals from reaching their full potential. I am committed to creating an academic environment that is free from discrimination and bias, and where everyone feels safe to express themselves without fear of retribution.
Equity is also an essential component of JEDI. I believe that everyone should have access to the same resources and opportunities to achieve their goals. As a PhD student in engineering, I recognize that there are disparities in access to educational and research opportunities based on factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. I am committed to working to address these disparities by promoting equity in academic settings. This includes advocating for fair and transparent hiring and promotion processes, as well as providing support and resources to individuals from underrepresented backgrounds.
Diversity is another critical aspect of JEDI. I believe that diversity of perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds is essential to creating a thriving and innovative scientific community. I understand the importance of having a diverse range of voices at the table. I am committed to promoting diversity by encouraging the recruitment and retention of individuals from underrepresented groups, as well as creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for individuals of all backgrounds.
Finally, inclusion is the glue that holds justice, equity, and diversity together. I believe that inclusion requires creating an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and supported. Inclusion means fostering a culture of open communication and collaboration, where diverse perspectives are welcomed and appreciated. As a PhD student in engineering, I am committed to creating an inclusive academic environment by promoting open communication and collaboration, as well as providing support and resources to all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
In addition to these core principles, I believe that there are several concrete actions that can be taken to promote JEDI in the academic community. These include:
-	Providing training and resources to faculty, staff, and students on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion
-	Establishing policies and practices that promote fairness and transparency in hiring and promotion processes
-	Developing mentorship programs to support individuals from underrepresented groups
-	Providing financial support and resources to help individuals from underrepresented backgrounds succeed in academia
-	Creating opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds to share their experiences and perspectives with the broader academic community
As a South East Asian female PhD student in engineering, I recognize that there is still much work to be done to promote JEDI in the academic community. However, I am committed to doing my part to create a more just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive scientific community. By working together and supporting one another, we can create a world where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential and contribute to the scientific community.
