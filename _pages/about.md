I hold a PhD from the University of Washington, Seattle, where my research focused on human driver sequential decision-making in complex traffic scenarios. My work applies machine learning and AI to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles, particularly in mixed-traffic environments. I earned my bachelor's from Technion - Israel Institute of Technology and hold dual master's degrees in Transportation Engineering and Computer and Systems Engineering from the University of Washington.

My research interests span human-automation interaction, cognitive modeling, and AI. Iâ€™ve contributed to projects involving in-vehicle driver monitoring using deep learning, transit spatial pattern recognition, and transportation data management. As a Data Science for Social Good Fellow at the e-Science Institute, I developed semi-supervised learning methods to improve transit user origin-destination patterns in Seattle.

I also played a key role in an NIH-funded project, developing a fitness-to-drive metric for young adults with concussions using virtual reality scenarios and advanced data analysis. My experience includes internships in Natural Language Processing (NLP), expanding my AI expertise across domains.

My work has been recognized with the 3 Minute Thesis competition win and the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Award at UW, along with the Senator Scott White Memorial Scholarship, the William A. Bulley Fellowship, and the Outstanding Graduate Student Award. I am also an active member of the ACP-70 Standing Committee on Highway Traffic Monitoring under the Transportation Research Board.

Beyond research, I am dedicated to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in engineering and data science.
