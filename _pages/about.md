I am a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle, working to understand human driver's decision making process in complex traffic scenarios to help in safe deployment of autonomous vehicles on-road, especially in a mixed-traffic envrionment. I have completed my bachelors from Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. I also have masters degrees in Transportation Engineering and Computer and Systems Engineering from the University of Washington.

My research interests are at the interface of Transportation, Humam-Automation Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. I have worked on research projects spanning in-vehicle driver monitoring, transit travel behavior spatial pattern recognition and transportation database management. I was previously a Data Science for Social Good Fellow with the e-Science Institute at UW where I worked on imroving origin-destination patterns for transit users in Seattle using semi-supervised learning based methodology. I have previously been awarded the Senator Scott White Memmorial, William A. Bulleys and Outstanding Graduate student awards for my work in the field of transportation.
