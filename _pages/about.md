I am a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle, working to understand human driver's decision making process in complex traffic scenarios to help in safe deployment of autonomous vehicles on-road, especially in a mixed-traffic envrionment. I have completed my bachelors from Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. I also have masters in Transportation Engineering and in Computer and Systems Engineering from the University of Washington.

My research interests are broadly at the interface of humam-automation interaction, human cognitive modeling  and artificial intelligence. I have worked on research projects spanning in-vehicle driver monitoring, transit spatial pattern recognition and transportation database management. I was previously a Data Science for Social Good Fellow with the e-Science Institute at UW where I worked on imroving origin-destination patterns for transit users in Seattle using semi-supervised learning based methodology. I have previously been awarded the Senator Scott White Memmorial scholarship by the Women in Transportation Seminar, William A. Bulley fellowship by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Outstanding Graduate student award by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. 

I am currently a memeber of the ACP-70 Standing Committee on Highway Traffic Monitoring, Transportation Research Board, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

Outside of research, I am highly involved in acitivities related to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts in research and engineering. You can view my statement [here](https://github.com/mayureeb/mayureeb.github.io/blob/master/_pages/JEDI.pdf).
